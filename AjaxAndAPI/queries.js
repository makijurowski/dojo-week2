/* poke API

Make call, wait using callback, dynamically pull up content using jQuery

APIs are what we're querying and how we're interfacing with the queries, and AJAX is doing things without
refreshing the page

jQuery.get(url [,data][, success][, dataType])
^ Load data from the server using an HTTP get request

dataType can be xml, json, script, text, html
